## About Memory Builder

You need a tool to help yourself remember difficult concepts by memory? This is an app for creating lists of questions and answers in order to memorize them. Set time goals for memorizing those answers. Share them with your colleagues and let them help you in the process. 

## Made with...

- Laravel + Jetstream (Livewire)

## Features

- Create the list of questions.
- Create questions and give the answear (this is the first stage of the learning process).
- Click "Test" and you will review each question by random. Give the answer speaking out loud or you just think about it and then, check by yourself how was the answer (wrong / so-so / correct).
- The app will save your result, pass to the other question, and after a while it will test you again with the questions that were wrong or so-so.
- The goal is to remember all your answers by repetition.
- Next: you will be able to share your lists of questions with your partners, and after help them or let them help you build your lists of questions.
